# Developing Environment 

## Kotlin 

On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers.
Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler.
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library,but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

## Android 

Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance,with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google.

Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008.
The current stable version is Android 10, released on September 3, 2019. 

## Android Studio 

Android Studio supports all the same programming languages of IntelliJ 
e.g. Java, C++, and more with extensions, such as Go; and Android Studio 3.0 or later supports Kotlin and all Java 7 language features and
a subset of Java 8 language features that vary by platform version.

The following features are provided in the current stable version:.

1) Android-specific refactoring and quick fixes.
2) Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility and other problems.
3) ProGuard integration and app-signing capabilities.
4) Template-based wizards to create common Android designs and components.
5) A rich layout editor that allows users to drag-and-drop UI components,option to preview layouts on multiple screen configurations.
6) Support for building Android Wear apps.
7) Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, enabling integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (Earlier 'Google Cloud Messaging')and Google App Engine.
8) Android Virtual Device (Emulator) to run and debug apps in the Android studio.

## Firebase 


Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Firebase, Inc. in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014.As of March 2020, the Firebase platform has 19 products, which are used by more than 1.5 million apps.

### Some features and services provided by Firebase 

Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a cost-free app measurement solution that provides insights on app usage and user engagement.

Develop.
Firebase Cloud Messaging.
Formerly known as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform solution for messages and notifications for Android, iOS, and web applications, which as of 2016 can be used at no cost.

Firebase Authentication.
Firebase Authentication is a service that can authenticate users using only client-side code. It supports social login providers Facebook, GitHub, Twitter and Google as well as other service providers like Google Play Games, Apple, Yahoo, and Microsoft. Additionally, it includes a user management system whereby developers can enable user authentication with email and password login stored with Firebase.

Firebase Realtime Database.
Firebase provides a real-time database and back-end as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud.[26][27] The company provides client libraries that enable integration with Android, iOS, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Swift and Node.js applications. The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS, React, Ember.js and Backbone.js.[28] The REST API uses the Server-Sent Events protocol, which is an API for creating HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. Developers using the realtime database can secure their data by using the company's server-side-enforced security rules.

Cloud Firestore.
On January 31, 2019, Cloud Firestore was officially brought out of beta, making it an official product of the Firebase lineup.It is the successor to Firebase's original databasing system, Real-time Database, and allows for nested documents and fields rather than the tree-view provided in the Real-time Database.

Firebase Storage.
Firebase Storage provides secure file uploads and downloads for Firebase apps, regardless of network quality, to be used for storing images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. It is backed by Google Cloud Storage.

Firebase Hosting.

Firebase Hosting is a static and dynamic web hosting service that launched on May 13, 2014. It supports hosting static files such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript and other files, as well as support through Cloud Functions.The service delivers files over a content delivery network (CDN) through HTTP Secure (HTTPS) and Secure Sockets Layer encryption (SSL). Firebase partners with Fastly, a CDN, to provide the CDN backing Firebase Hosting. The company states that Firebase Hosting grew out of customer requests; developers were using Firebase for its real-time database but needed a place to host their content.
